  /** 
   *  HD Wallet (Hierarchical-Deterministic Wallets) are loosly based upon 
   *  Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 0032  https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032
   *
   *  Goal: For privacy, most transactions should only have one input and one
   *  output and a new address should be used for every output. In the case of
   *  change, a transaction may have 2 outputs.   After a sufficient number of
   *  single input, single output transactions occur it may be safe to combine
   *  two inputs into a single output.  
   *
   *  If you wanted to send someone 100 BTC you would normally create a single
   *  transaction with N inputs that total 100 BTC.  This transaction would leak
   *  information that there is a high probability than those N inputs all belong
   *  to the same individual and a single compromised input would then compromise
   *  all of the inputs.  
   *
   *  Using HD wallets, you would a series of N transactions each with 1 input and
   *  1 output, perhaps one of them would have 2 outputs for change.  The receiver
   *  would be able to 'group' these into a single payment by deriving all of the
   *  output addresses from a single 'transaction parent key' that is in turn
   *  derived from the account key.    Using this approach it is also possible
   *  for there to be subscription payments using a unique address for each payment.
   *
   *  An account is intended for each individual you do business with. You would
   *  give them the extended public key and for each transaction they would derive
   *  a new exended public key and then derive a unique public key for 
   *
   *  The intended use is for accounts to be created via private derivation,
   *  while trx and address children are created via public derivation.
